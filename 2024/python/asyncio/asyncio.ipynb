    "`asyncio.gather` and `asyncio.wait` are both functions in Python's asyncio library that deal with scheduling and controlling multiple tasks at once. While they have several similarities, there are also key differences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Return Values**:\n",
    "   - `asyncio.gather`: returns the results of all tasks as a single list in the order they were passed in, regardless of the order in which they completed.\n",
    "   - `asyncio.wait`: returns a pair of sets. The first set contains the futures that completed (either because they finished or because an error occurred) and the second includes the ones that didn't.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cancelling**:\n",
    "   - `asyncio.gather`: if the `gather` call is cancelled, all subtasks will be cancelled.\n",
    "   - `asyncio.wait`: if the `wait` is cancelled, it will cancel all provided tasks that are still running and immediately return.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Error Handling**:\n",
    "   - `asyncio.gather`: raises the first exception that was raised by one of the tasks. If `return_exceptions=True` is passed to `gather()`, exceptions are treated the same as successful results, and gathered in the result list.\n",
    "   - `asyncio.wait`: does not raise exceptions from the tasks. You need to check each Future's `exception()` method manually.\n",
    "   \n",
    "In summary, the choice between them depends on your use case. If you want to simply run multiple tasks concurrently and gather their results, `asyncio.gather` is a good choice. If you need more control over which tasks have completed and which haven't, or need to handle exceptions manually, `asyncio.wait` may be the better choice."
